Keichi Takahashi, an assistant professor at SDLab, presented the following
[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437359.3465571) at the [Practice &
Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC)](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc21/)
conference:

> Keichi Takahashi, Wassapon Watanakeesuntorn, Kohei Ichikawa, Joseph Park,
> Ryousei Takano, Jason Haga, George Sugihara, Gerald M. Pao, “kEDM: A
> Performance-portable Implementation of Empirical Dynamic Modeling using
> Kokkos”, Practice & Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC 2021),
> Jul. 2021.

In this work, we developed and evaluated a performance-portable implementation
of Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) named [kEDM](https://github.com/keichi/kEDM)
using the Kokkos programming framework.
