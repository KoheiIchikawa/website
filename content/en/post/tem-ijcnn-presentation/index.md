Kundjanasith Thonglek presented the following paper at [International Joint Conference
on Neural Networks (IJCNN)](https://wcci2020.org/ijcnn-2020-program/) of IEEE Word Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) 2020

> Retraining Quantized Neural Network Models with Unlabeled Data
> Kundjanasith Thonglek, Keichi Takahashi, Kohei Ichikawa, Chawanat Nakasan, Hidemoto Nakada, Ryousei Takano and Hajimu Iida

In this paper, we focus on the fact that we can not always access the original labeled datasets because of privacy policies and license limitations. Thus, we proposed the method to retraining the quantized neural network models with unlabeled dataset.
This project is collaborated with National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).
