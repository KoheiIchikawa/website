Mr. Guoqing Li, who has been staying at our lab as an internship student,
presented his work on April 13, 2020. Mr. Li is an undergraduate student at
[Chiang Mai University](https://www.cmu.ac.th/en/), Thailand, and he has been
working on a research internship at our lab since January this year.

Mr. Li's research topic is entitled "Comparative Performance Study of Cloud
Native Hypervisors." He conducted an extensive performance evaluation of
emerging container runtimes and hypervisors that provide better isolation than
conventional container runtimes.

Good job!
